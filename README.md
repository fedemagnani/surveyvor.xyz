# Main Smart Contracts
- Before funding the survey, surveyprod must grant allowance to the gnosis contract at least for the _survey_gas amount
- By submitting the answer to the survey, surveyprod grant allowance to the respondent for the _amount_prize amount 

# Survey
- Every survey must ask for the mail of the guy (maybe we can ask the guy to submit its mail once that it connects)
- Mail could be a hedge against sybil attacks
